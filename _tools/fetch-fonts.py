"""Re-download the self-hosted web fonts from Google and rebuild /lib/fonts.css.

Run this after changing which families or weights the site uses:

    python3 _tools/fetch-fonts.py

It asks Google for exactly the stylesheet the pages used to link to, keeps the
@font-face blocks verbatim, and rewrites only the src URLs to /lib/fonts/. That
is deliberate: rendering then matches what Google served by construction, rather
than depending on anyone's judgement about weights and unicode ranges.

Subsets outside KEEP are dropped. unicode-range meant the browser never fetched
them anyway, so this costs nothing at runtime and keeps ~20 files out of the repo.

   Generated from the Google Fonts css2 response by _tools/fetch-fonts.py.
   The @font-face blocks below are Google's own, unchanged except that each
   src URL now points at /lib/fonts/ instead of fonts.gstatic.com - so
   rendering is identical to what the site did before, by construction rather
   than by my judgement.

   Why self-hosted: fonts.googleapis.com was the only third party left on the
   site, and the browser's request to it carries the visitor's IP address.
   Removing it is the difference between the privacy notice saying "one third
   party receives your IP" and saying "none". It is also faster - one less DNS
   lookup, TCP connection and TLS handshake before any text can paint.

   Subsets kept: latin, latin-ext, gurmukhi. Google also serves cyrillic,
   cyrillic-ext, greek and vietnamese; no page uses them.
